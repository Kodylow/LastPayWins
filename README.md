# Last Pay Wins

**THIS IS A WIP - YOU MIGHT NOT GET PAID** If you'd like your money back, DM [@_alexlewin](https://twitter.com/_alexlewin) on Twitter.

This was created for the Pleb.fi Miami 2023 Hackathon. (Won 2nd Place)

It's Reddit's r/thebutton but with sats... Last one to pay when the timer hits zero wins. Paying the invoice resets the timer.

Similar to FOMO3D, but with sats.
